    "- Kelvin (K) is a way to measure temperature, just like Celsius or Fahrenheit. But instead of talking about \"hot\" or \"cold,\" scientists use kelvin to describe temperature in terms of energy. The Boltzmann constant (k) is a special number that connects temperature and energy. When we say 1 kelvin, it means that energy follows a fixed rule, and this rule is based on the Boltzmann constant (1.380649 × 10⁻²³).\n",
