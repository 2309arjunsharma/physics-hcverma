    "- Physics is the study of nature and its laws\n",
    "- Revealing the laws of nature from observed events is Physics\n",
    "- Physics is concerned with the basic rules which are applicable to all domains of life\n",
    "- Understanding of physics, therefore, leads to applications in many fields including bio and medical sciences\n",
    "- Physics is like big chess game played by Nature.\n",
    "- We have only discovered the rules through famous physicists like Aryabhat, Newton, Einstein or Feynman\n",
    "- They are great physicists because from the observations available at that time, they could guess and frame the laws of physics which explained these observations"
