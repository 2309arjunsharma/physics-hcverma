    "- In the mid-1660s, Newton reflected on why apples fall straight down. He realized the same force pulling the apple to Earth also governs celestial bodies. By 1687, in his ___Principia Mathematica___, Newton formulated the law of universal gravitation: every mass attracts every other mass, with force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance. This unified terrestrial and celestial mechanics, explaining both falling objects and the Moon’s orbit. Newton’s insight transformed science, replacing earlier ideas from Aristotle and Galileo with a precise mathematical framework. His theory remained dominant until Einstein’s relativity refined gravity’s nature centuries later.\n",

    "- So, the development of the general theory was done by ___Isaac Newton___ (1642-1727)"
